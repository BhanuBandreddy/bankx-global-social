# TRUST Oracle System Documentation

## Overview

Based on code analysis, the current TRUST Oracle system in the GlobalSocial platform operates as a foundational trust scoring mechanism integrated into user profiles. Here's a comprehensive breakdown of every element and how the gamification system works.

## Current Trust Oracle Implementation

### Database Schema (from `shared/schema.ts`)

## Gen Z Gamification Mechanics

### Current Implementation Analysis

#### 1. **Trust Score Metrics**
The system currently uses a simple integer trust score, but here's how it's designed to scale:

**Base Calculation:**
```javascript
// Simplified trust score factors
trustScore = baseScore(50) + 
             transactionSuccess * 2 +
             socialEngagement * 1 +
             accountAge * 0.5 +
             verificationStatus * 10
```

#### 2. **Gamification Value Proposition**

**"Flex Your Trust" System:**
- **Scoreboard Status**: Trust score as social currency and status symbol
- **Progression Rewards**: Unlockable features, badges, and perks at milestone levels
- **Social Proof**: High trust scores = social validation and increased opportunities
- **Economic Benefits**: Better deals, lower escrow requirements, priority access

#### 3. **Gen Z Language & Metrics**

**Trust Level Names:**
- **0-25**: "Getting Started" (No cap, just building)
- **26-50**: "On the Come Up" (Progress mode activated)  
- **51-75**: "Pretty Solid" (Respect earned)
- **76-100**: "Straight Fire" (Maximum credibility achieved)

**Achievement Badges:**
- "First Deal" - Complete initial transaction
- "Squad Builder" - Help 5+ people successfully
- "Local Legend" - Top trust in your area
- "Global Player" - International transaction success
