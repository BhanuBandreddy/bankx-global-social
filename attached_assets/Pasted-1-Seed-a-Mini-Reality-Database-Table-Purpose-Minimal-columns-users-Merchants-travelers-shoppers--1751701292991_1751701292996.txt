1 Seed a “Mini-Reality” Database
Table	Purpose	Minimal columns
users	Merchants, travelers, shoppers	id, name, role ENUM('merchant','traveler','shopper'), trust_score
products	Items merchants list	id, merchant_id, title, price_usd, city, stock
trips	Traveler routes that can carry packages	id, traveler_id, from_city, to_city, depart_utc, capacity_kg
requests	Shopper wish-list or purchase intent	id, shopper_id, product_id, qty, status ENUM('open','matched','delivered')
matches	Conductor-made pairings of request ↔ trip	id, request_id, trip_id, escrow_id
escrows	TrustPay money lock	id, amount, currency, state ENUM('held','released','disputed')

Seed script: Insert 3 merchants, 5 products, 2 travelers, 2 trips.
Example JSON seed → run once in Replit:

await db.insertInto('users').values([
  {id:'u_m1',name:'SneakerHub NYC',role:'merchant',trust_score:92},
  {id:'u_t1',name:'Raj Traveler', role:'traveler',trust_score:88},
  {id:'u_s1',name:'Maya Shopper', role:'shopper',trust_score:75},
]);
await db.insertInto('products').values([
  {id:'p_1',merchant_id:'u_m1',title:'Nike Air Max 270',price_usd:150,city:'New York',stock:10},

await db.insertInto('trips').values([
  {id:'trp_1', traveler_id:'u_t1', from_city:'New York', to_city:'Bengaluru', depart_utc:'2025-07-07T02:00:00Z', capacity_kg:8},

2 Update Conductor Planning Prompt

You have real data. If user asks for an item:
1. Lookup products LIKE %query% AND city = user.city_wish.
2. Lookup trips from that city to user's home.
3. If found, propose match with price and traveler ETA.
Return friendly offer. If none, say you’ll watch feed.
Never talk about tool calls or agent counts.
Quick lookup helper (Node / Drizzle)
ts
Copy

async function findOffer(query:string, homeCity:string){
  const product = await db.select().from('products')
     .where(sql`title ILIKE ${'%'+query+'%'}`).limit(1);
  if(!product.length) return null;

  const trip = await db.select().from('trips')
     .where({from_city:product[0].city,to_city:homeCity}).limit(1);
  if(!trip.length) return null;

  return { product:product[0], trip:trip[0] };
}
Call that inside your tool so the LLM can do:

json

{
 "name":"offer_match",
 "arguments":{"query":"sneakers","homeCity":"Bengaluru"}
}
and Conductor replies with:

“Great news! Raj is flying New York → Bengaluru on 7 Jul.
He can carry up to 8 kg and has room for one pair of Nike Air Max 270 ($150).
Shall I secure it in escrow for you?”

3 UX polish in Chat
Tag suggestions (buttons under text box): “🛍️ Products”, “✈️ Trips”, “📦 Track”.
On click, pre-fill prompt templates so users ask concrete things.

Context chips in replies: show product card + traveler card inline (makes the response feel factual).

Fallback flow: If findOffer() returns null, reply:

“No traveler currently on that route. I’ll monitor new trips and ping you.”

4 Keep the demo tight
5 real-looking messages showcase full cycle:

greet → 2) ask for sneakers → 3) Blink offers match → 4) user accepts → 5) TrustPay confirms escrow.

Hard-code escrow success rather than wiring Stripe right now—UI just shows “Escrow 🟢 Held”.

5 What Replit reviewers will see
Realistic dialogue with concrete names, dates, prices.

No boilerplate “coordinated with 0 agents” lines—only useful offers.

A minimal dataset that makes every test drive deterministic (no random hallucinations).

Deliver this seeding + lookup layer and your Ask Blink chat will finally feel alive and credible for product demos while the full multi-agent engine grows behind the scenes.
