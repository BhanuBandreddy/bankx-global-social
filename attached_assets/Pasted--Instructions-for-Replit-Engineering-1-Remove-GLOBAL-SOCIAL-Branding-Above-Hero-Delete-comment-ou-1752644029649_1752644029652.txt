 Instructions for Replit Engineering
1. Remove GLOBAL SOCIAL Branding Above Hero
Delete/comment out any <div> or element above the canvas displaying “GLOBAL SOCIAL”.

The user’s name will now serve as the primary overlay label.

2. Shrink "PLAY" and "Upload your song" Buttons
Update the button styles:

Font size: Change from 1.2rem/1.5rem down to 1rem or 0.9rem.

Padding: Change from 13px 40px to something more compact, e.g., 8px 22px.

Border-radius: Adjust as needed (e.g., 14px).

Reduce margins/gaps between buttons for a more modern, compact look.

If using Tailwind, example:

jsx
<button className="px-6 py-2 rounded-lg text-base font-semibold">PLAY</button>
3. Username Overlay ON the Light Ray (Like CodePen)
Place the username label INSIDE the canvas container, not above it.

Position it absolutely, centered horizontally, with top ~50% of canvas height (or slightly above the midline of the light ray—experiment visually for the best placement).

Use a simple white, semi-bold font. Add light drop shadow for contrast (e.g., text-shadow: 0 2px 4px #000 or Tailwind drop-shadow).

Example Vanilla React/JSX for Inside the Hero Section:

jsx
<div className="relative w-full h-[700px]">
  <canvas /* ...the Three.js/WebGL Canvas... */ />
  <div
    className="absolute left-1/2 top-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-[80%] text-white text-2xl font-semibold drop-shadow"
    style={{ pointerEvents: 'none', zIndex: 3 }} // so mouse can pass through
  >
    {userName}
  </div>
  {/* PLAY / UPLOAD buttons - make smaller */}
  <div className="absolute w-full top-9 flex justify-center gap-4 z-10">
    <button className="px-6 py-2 rounded-lg text-base font-semibold">PLAY</button>
    <button className="px-6 py-2 rounded-lg text-base font-semibold">Upload your song</button>
  </div>
</div>
Adjust top-1/2 -translate-y-[80%] as needed so that the username sits directly over the light ray (not too high/too low).

4. Additional Polishing
Remove any unneeded additional text or spacers to ensure the light ray and username are visually dominant.

Always keep the username visible in front of the animation by setting a higher z-index than the canvas, but lower than the controls.

5. TL;DR Checklist for Team:
 Remove “GLOBAL SOCIAL” static label above hero.

 Shrink “PLAY” and “Upload your song” controls: smaller font, tighter padding, rounded buttons.

 Insert user name as a centered <div> within the hero, absolutely placed over the light ray with good contrast.

 Ensure username always renders above the animation.

 Final result: only the username overlays the visualization, controls are compact, no redundant branding above.

If you want code changes made for you, send:
Your current hero section React/JSX file, and

(Ideally) your main layout/page source file.

And I’ll return the exact up-to-date file to drop into your project.
