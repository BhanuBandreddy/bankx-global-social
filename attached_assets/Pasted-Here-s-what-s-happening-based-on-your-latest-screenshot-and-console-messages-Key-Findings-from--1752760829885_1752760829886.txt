Here's what's happening, based on your latest screenshot and console messages:

Key Findings from Console
Your app is repeatedly showing:

text
Reddit auth response status: 401
OAuth failed for /r/nyc, trying public JSON...
Public Reddit API error for /r/nyc: 403 Blocked
and similar messages for every subreddit attempted.

Diagnosis
401 Unauthorized:
This means the Reddit API did not accept your credentials or there is something missing/wrong with the authentication.

403 Blocked (Public API access):
Reddit has restricted unauthenticated/public API access—that's why fallback fetches are also blocked.

Causes (and How To Fix)
1. Incorrect API Call Flow
After getting an OAuth token, you should ONLY call endpoints through https://oauth.reddit.com, not https://www.reddit.com.

Ensure every authenticated API call includes these headers:

Authorization: bearer <access_token>

User-Agent: GlobalSocial/1.0 by u/No-Chocolate8095 (or your chosen string)

(Your user agent seems correct.)

2. Credentials or Flow Issues
Is your app POSTing to https://www.reddit.com/api/v1/access_token with client_id, client_secret, grant_type, and redirect_uri (and code if using Authorization Code flow)?

For "web app," you must use the Authorization Code Flow, NOT the client credentials flow.

This means the user needs to visit the authorization URL, approve your app, and you must exchange the returned code for a token.

3. Token Not Received or Used
If the access token request fails or is not used properly, all API requests will fail with 401.

If you are using a localhost or a mismatched redirect URI during OAuth, Reddit will reject.

Your registered redirect URI is:
https://your-replit-domain.replit.dev/redirect
You must use this exact URI during the OAuth process.

4. Possible Client Mistake
If you try "client_credentials" grant instead of "authorization_code" with a "web app," it will silently fail with 401—Reddit only allows "client_credentials" for "script" apps.

How to Unblock
Step-by-step:
Start the OAuth Flow:

Direct user to:

text
https://www.reddit.com/api/v1/authorize?client_id=Ebl4ILj_HGaiaMnnt3MKqw&response_type=code&state=<random>&redirect_uri=https://your-replit-domain.replit.dev/redirect&duration=permanent&scope=read
User Consents and Gets Redirected Back:

With ?state=...&code=...

Exchange the Code for a Token:

POST to:

text
https://www.reddit.com/api/v1/access_token
with:

text
grant_type=authorization_code
code=<code from step 2>
redirect_uri=https://your-replit-domain.replit.dev/redirect
Add HTTP Basic Auth header: (client_id:client_secret)

With Token, Make API Requests:

Use https://oauth.reddit.com/... endpoints and the Authorization: bearer <token> header.

TL;DR: What You Need to Fix
Your app is set as a web app (not a script app).

You must follow the Authorization Code Flow (user must log in and approve).

Your requests probably failed because:

You tried "client_credentials" grant, which is forbidden for web apps.

You used tokens with the wrong endpoints or without proper headers.

You mismatched redirect URIs.

All data fetches must use https://oauth.reddit.com with the bearer token.

What to Do Next:
Update your authentication flow to use Authorization Code grant (see Reddit OAuth docs).

Double-check that redirect URIs match exactly, including scheme (https).

Never use the client credentials flow for a web app; only use this for "script" apps (personal/private bots).

Ensure tokens are included in every request.
